# Hi, I’m Neha Kumari 👋
Backend engineer • Golang enthusiast • systems thinker

I build scalable, maintainable backend systems and developer-friendly frameworks with a strong focus on performance and reliability. I enjoy turning complex problems into clean solutions — whether that's a reusable Go framework, a high-throughput data pipeline, or resilient microservices.

- 🔭 I’m currently working as **SDE II at Zopsmart** (Backend / Golang)
- 🌱 I’m learning and exploring advanced distributed systems patterns, observability, and production-grade reliability
- 💬 Ask me about Go, system design, testing strategies, or performance tuning

## 🚀 What I build (high level)
- **Reusable Go frameworks** that speed up development and reduce duplication across services  
- **Data ingestion & processing pipelines** for multi-format sources (CSV, JSON, DBs, search engines)  
- **Microservices** with strong testing, observability, and clean interfaces (gRPC / PubSub)  
- **DevOps-friendly apps** that run on container platforms and integrate with CI/CD

## 🧰 Tech stack
**Languages:** Golang, C++  
**Databases:** Postgres, MySQL, MongoDB, Cassandra  
**Messaging / Stream:** Kafka, Azure EventHub  
**Cloud & Infra:** Azure, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Rancher  
**Observability:** Prometheus, Grafana, tracing & structured logging  
**Tools:** Git, GitHub, Jira, Swagger, Postman, CI/CD pipelines
